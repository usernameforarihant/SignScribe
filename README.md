## SignScribe: Sign Language Interpretation and Speech-to-Sign App

SignScribe is a web application built with Streamlit and Python that bridges the gap between sign language and spoken language communication. We plan that it utilizes three machine learning models to achieve seamless communication:

* **Sign Language Interpretation:** This model interprets hand gestures captured through a webcam and converts them into corresponding words.
* **Sentence Completion/Correction:** The interpreted words are then processed by another model, which constructs grammatically correct and complete sentences from them.
* **Speech-to-Sign Conversion:** Finally, the completed sentences are fed into a third model, which generates real-time sign language animations for the other user to understand.

**Getting Started**

To run SignScribe, you'll need the following:

* Python 3.x (with required libraries: Streamlit, OpenCV, and appropriate machine learning frameworks for your chosen models)
* A webcam

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/signscribe.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

**Using SignScribe**

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.(The link will appear in your terminal as well.)

* Enable webcam access when prompted.
* Use clear and consistent hand gestures within the webcam frame for accurate interpretation.
* The app will display the interpreted text and the corresponding sign language animation for the other user.
